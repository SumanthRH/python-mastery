# TODO
- [ ] Dive deeper into inheritance with class methods. Any pitfalls? 
- [ ] Class variables were mentioned in passing in the course. Go deeper into when to use/ not use class variables.
- [ ] Custom init for `unittest.TestCase`? Haven't seen this even in  ðŸ¤—PEFT.
- [ ] Dive deeper into the `__new__` special method.
- [ ] What are some use cases for the `weakref` module?
- [ ] Dive deeper into descriptor objects
- [ ] Understand `super()` better: what happens when called in a staticmethod? What about one or two argument versions of `super()`?
- [ ] Revisit the tricky use of generators in exercise 8.5
- [ ] Fear and awaiting in Async
